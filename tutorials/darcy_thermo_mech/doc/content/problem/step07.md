## AD Material Properties

In reality the viscosity is also a function of temperature, this dependence can be optionally added
in a manner that leverages the AD calculations.

The permability is defined as a function of space and time; for some problems (e.g., solid mechanics)
the Jacobian will be dependant upon this function, due to displacement calculations.
